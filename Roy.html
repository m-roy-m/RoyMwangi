<p1 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Bayern munich is arguable the best team in the history of football. What this club has done to football is absolutely unbelievable.</br>The record German champions and six time champions league winners have produced legends that have been known not only in the region but also internationally. The likes of Franz Beckenbauer, Oliver Kahn, Frank Ribery and Arjen Robben are just but a few of the legends the club have produced. It also had brought up great players who after playing for the team took their experience elsewhere and shined for example Thiago and Lewandoski. Arguably one of the best goalkeepers in history,Manuel Neuer, also hails from this club.</br>Bayern is also a club built with values and promotes teamwork.Even from the tiniest detail of the club name being on top of the player name on the jersey clearly shows the core principles of the club.Their values and principal which have been upheld throughout their existence have given them the winner mentality that they have. The club is also partly owned by its city Munich and therefire olayers have to be in touch with the German culture to enjoy their time.</br>The club also attends the annual oktoberfest in their city which leads to creation of the greates kits of the season. The players drink beer and participate in other various German games.
